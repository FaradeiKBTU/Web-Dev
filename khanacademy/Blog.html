        <p>Yesterday I went to the cinema to watch Fast & Furious 100.<br>
I went with my friends in the evening. The cinema was big and very crowded.<br>

The movie was loud and full of action. There were many fast cars, races, and explosions.<br>
The main characters were brave and cool, like always. Sometimes the movie was unrealistic, but it was still fun to watch.<br>

I liked the music and the special effects. The film was long, but I didn’t get bored.<br>
After the movie, we talked about our favorite scenes.<br>

I enjoyed the movie and had a good time at the cinema.</p>

        <p>Yesterday I decided to cook borscht by myself.<br>
It was my first time cooking this dish, and I was a little nervous.<br><br>

First, I prepared all the ingredients: meat, potatoes, beetroot, carrots, onion, and cabbage.
I cut the vegetables and started cooking the soup step by step.<br>
The process took a lot of time, but it was interesting.<br><br>

At first, I thought I would make mistakes, but everything went better than I expected.<br>
The borscht had a nice color and a good smell.<br>
When I tried it, I was surprised — it was really tasty.<br><br>

In the end, I was proud of myself.<br>
Now I know that I can cook borscht, and I want to try cooking it again in the future.</p>
